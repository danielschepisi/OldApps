    - Card Matching Game: 
        - No surprises here, it’s a card matching game

SWIFT 


- First Real Project
    - This is probably the most complex app I’ve created. I was recreating from scratch the code to mirror an app that was written in Obj-C as an exercise (without seeing the Obj-C code). This is an incomplete implementation. And I’d approach it very differently now. 
- Sedgwick Swamplands
    - The main branch should have a working implementation of being able to add chores to a table view. This uses CoreData. They can either be sorted by Paddock or by Tasks
- Clima
    - Fetches weather data and updates UI 
- Destini
    - This is a fun little choose your own adventure story.
- FlashChat
    - This is one of my favourites because I got a friend to install the app and was able to message back and forth. 
- Quizzler
    - Fun little quiz app
- Tipsy
    - Divides a (dinner) bill between the chosen number of people


SWIFT UI
- Note worth looking at here. It’s extremely basic.

MACHINE LEARING
- This is just from a course I did on Machine Learning
